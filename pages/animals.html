                    Squirrels love pumpkins. They also play, chase each other, fight for the pumpkin, and vocalize all
                    sort of calls.

                Animals and humans have an ambiguous relationship: at once close and antagonistic.
            </p>
            <p class="sans">
                Animals share considerable physical and chemical features with humans.
                They court to mate and the youth learn by play.
                We bury pets in cemeteries and print animal cartoons all over children's clothing.
                And we slaughter 100 billion of them each year and have caused the global collapse of over 75% of
                wildlife populations since the 1960s.
            </p>
            <p class="sans">
                This dichotomy creates deep intellectual, philosophical, and ethical paradoxes, which I believe it is
                time for humankind to address.

                In my research and explorations, I have studied animal behavior for several years.
                I have applied physics to understand how birds flock together, how sheep herds stay cohesive under
                pressure,
                and how fireflies synchronize their flashes.
                <!-- Others have uncovered patterns in the behavior of individuals. -->

                My outdoor peregrinations have brought mesmerizing encounters with wildlife:
                foxes, bears, bobcats, coyotes, horses, burros, mountain goats...
                Merely observing squirrels and chipmunks scuffling around my backyard brings me a lot of joy.
                I participate in various conservation projects.<label for="mn-demo"

                Animals are fascinating.
                There is something profound about considering how beings with a different sensory and cognitive
                system might experience the same reality as us.
            </p>
            <p class="sans">
                There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence demonstrating that animals are
                sentient: capable of consciousness, emotion, agency.<label for="mn-demo"
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                Some species even exhibit complex collective traits akin to language and culture.

                I would like to help reconcile humans with their earthbound counterparts.
                I think modern AI, and LLMs in particular, offer the prospect of monumental advances in our
                understanding of animal behavior and communication.
            </p>
            <p class="sans">
                I am looking to join efforts to advance the field of interspecies communication.
                Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat.
            </p>
            <p class="sans">
                This is also for us: what we learn about animals will redefine our perception of our place in the world
                &mdash; as when astronomy put the Sun at the center.
