# [Raphael Sarfati's personal website](https://raphaelsarfati.xyz)

My scientific research, personal interests, atheltic pursuits, and general peregrinations.

This website is based on the Global CSS template by [Bucky Maler](https://github.com/BuckyMaler) and [Sergey Melnik](https://www.behance.net/SergeyMelnik) (HTML5, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js). Many thanks to them for making this available. 

Many modifications were made to accomodate my own needs, with ChatGPT's guidance.
